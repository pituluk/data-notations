<p>Ada Lovelace was a 19th-century mathematician and writer. She is recognized as one of the first computer programmers due to her work on Charles Babbage’s early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>
<p>Her notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Lovelace’s visionary ideas about computers extended far beyond pure calculation.</p>
